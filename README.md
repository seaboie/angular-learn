# Tutorial

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Declare property `String`

- Use `get`

```ts
get cartLabel() {
    return `Cart ( ${this.cartService.cart().length} )`;
}
```

## Signal method

[Signal](https://angular.dev/essentials/signals)  
[Angular Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)

Manage State

### `set`

### `update(() => ...)`

```ts
import { signal } from "@angular/core";

// Create a signal with the `signal` function.
const firstName = signal("Morgan");

// Read a signal value by calling itâ€” signals are functions.
console.log(firstName());

// Change the value of this signal by calling its `set` method with a new value.
firstName.set("Jaime");

// You can also use the `update` method to change the value
// based on the previous value.
firstName.update((name) => name.toUpperCase());
```

## Computed expressions

[Computed expressions](https://angular.dev/essentials/signals#computed-expressions)

A `computed` signal is read-only; it does not have a `set` or an `update` method. Instead, the value of the `computed` signal automatically changes when any of the signals it reads change:

```ts
import { signal, computed } from "@angular/core";

const firstName = signal("Morgan");
const firstNameCapitalized = computed(() => firstName().toUpperCase());
console.log(firstNameCapitalized()); // MORGAN

firstName.set("Jaime");

console.log(firstNameCapitalized()); // JAIME
```

## Showing dynamic text

[Showing dynamic text](https://angular.dev/essentials/templates#showing-dynamic-text)

You can create a binding to show some dynamic text in a template by using double curly-braces:  
`{{...}}`

```ts
@Component({
  selector: "user-profile",
  template: `<h1>Profile for {{ userName() }}</h1>`,
})
export class TodoListItem {
  userName = signal("pro_programmer_123");
}
```

## Dependency Injection

[Dependency Injection](https://angular.dev/essentials/dependency-injection)

Reuse code and control behaviors across your application and tests.

Here is an example of a `Calculator` service.

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class Calculator {
  add(x: number, y: number) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
```  

### [How to use a service](https://angular.dev/essentials/dependency-injection#how-to-use-a-service)  

When you want to use a service in a component, you need to:
1. Import the service  
2. Declare a class field where the service is injected. Assign the class field to the result of the call of the built-in function `inject` which creates the service  

```ts
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Calculator } from './calculator';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-receipt',
  template: `<h1>The total is {{ totalCost }}</h1>`,
})
export class Receipt {
  private calculator = inject(Calculator);
  totalCost = this.calculator.add(50, 25);
}
```

## Use ` *ngFor() `  

> Must import `CommonModule`  
```ts
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  imports: [HousingLocationComponent, CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrl: './home.component.css',
})
export class HomeComponent {
  ...
}
```  

```ts
<section class="results">
    <app-housing-location
        *ngFor="let housingLocation of housingLocationList"
        [housingLocation]="housingLocation"
    />
</section>
```  

## ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ `(input)` event binding  

```ts
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Filter by City"
  #filter
  (input)="filterResults(filter.value)" // Listen to the 'input' event
/>
```  

To make the filtering happen as the user types, instead of waiting for a button click, you need to listen to the `(input)` event on the text input field. Here's what I've changed in your code:  

1. Import `FormsModule`: I've added `FormsModule` to the `imports` array in your `@Component` decorator. This module is necessary to work with form elements and their events.  

2. Listen to `(input)`: On the `<input>` element, I've added the `(input)` event binding. This event fires every time the value of the input field changes.  

3. Call `filterResults` on `input`: The `(input)` event binding calls your `filterResults method`, passing in the current value of the input field `(filter.value)`.  

Now, as the user types in the "Filter by City" input, the `filterResults` function will be executed on each keystroke, updating the `filteredLocationList` and instantly reflecting the changes in the displayed housing locations.  

## Template reference variable on `<input>`  

In your template, `#filter` creates a template reference variable on the `<input>` element:  

```ts
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Filter by City"
  #filter
  (input)="filterResults(filter.value)"
  (focus)="clearPlaceholder(filter)"
  (blur)="restorePlaceholder(filter)"
/>
```  

This `#filter` acts like a local name that you can use within the template to refer directly to that specific `<input>` element. It gives you a way to access the properties and methods of the underlying DOM element.  

Now, let's look at the event bindings:  

- `(focus)="clearPlaceholder(filter)"`:   
When the `focus` event occurs on the `<input>` element, Angular will execute the `clearPlaceholder method` in your `HomeComponent`. The `(filter)` part is passing the template reference variable (which points to the `<input>` element itself) as an argument to the `clearPlaceholder method`.  

- `(blur)="restorePlaceholder(filter)"`:   
Similarly, when the `blur` event occurs, Angular calls the `restorePlaceholder method`, again passing the template reference variable (filter) as an argument.  

Here's how your methods are defined in the component:  

```ts
clearPlaceholder(inputElement: HTMLInputElement) {
  inputElement.placeholder = '';
}

restorePlaceholder(inputElement: HTMLInputElement) {
  if (!inputElement.value) {
    inputElement.placeholder = this.originalPlaceholder;
  }
}
```
